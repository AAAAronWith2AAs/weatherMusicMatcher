# Project Description

As a music lover I want to be able to find music that fits the mood of the waether for that day in any desired city

## User Story

GIVEN a dashboard with an input
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with the current weather for that city and three random genres fitting the mood of the weather.
WHEN i view the current weather
THEN I am shown an icon representing weather conditions, the temperature, wind conditions, and humidity
WHEN I view the selected genres, I am presented with an option of liking a specific playlist, the playlist name, playlist picture, and a link to the playlist
THEN the liked playlist is added to a favorites list and the data persists
